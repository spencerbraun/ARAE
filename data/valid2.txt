i went into <caps> room and unplugged <caps> little black phone from the charger .
my mom was giving me all the steps on before starting the truck .
<caps> last reason is i know we have to admit it computers have made me and your life easier .
in conclusion the entire idea of having dirigibles landing on the empire state building was an accident waiting to happen .
people would like to learn about different things .
they can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to .
the mood that was created by the author is loving .
where i was extremely patient .
<caps> <caps> my cell phone buzzes in my pocket .
in the horrible <num> degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that hes at risk of running out .
so i started to look into joining the <caps> <caps> team .
i will now get into more detail on these three topics .
computers allow our lives to be just as enjoyable as they are meaningful by getting our work done faster .
this would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so .
finally we came to the front of the line .
but it is <caps> and <caps> because they his parents had him and they had a house feel like a home to him .
the <caps> was amazingly epic .
the wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around .
this shows that he is grateful for his parents teaching him how important family and friends are .
i was waiting patiently for my mom .
also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations .
it could change the life style of everyone on the planet patience is one of the most important things on the planet .
all computers are helpful and not always something negative when someone uses it .
she bought herself a flower to cheer herself up .
it was on this perfect day that my friendship with <organization> was founded .
to me patience means you stand or sit there quiet and with no rude comments .
this is terrible because kids never get to spend time with family and do not show appreciation for <caps> their parents do for them .
the lines for you to purchase your items lead all the way to the back of the store .
a last example would be in paragraph <num> when the author describes the safety hazards .
my second reason would be education .
i think that it is a persons own personal decision dealing with which library they go to .
<caps> <caps> a day where there are no books in the school library .
laughter is a sign of good relationships .
for example the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
one day me and my brother went hunting at <caps> oaks .
in our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes .
the last time in the story <caps> the regard they <caps> will always remember her homeland
laughter helped the girls have a wonderful rest of the day .
people should learn how to deal with different struggles in life .
there was one <caps> in life when i was patient .
every wall was filled with endless color .
so had to come right back in the house .
most people who met him thought he was a god and when he heard people talking about him like that he would always get very upset .
one rainy afternoon on a <date> my little brothers friends mum called and needed me to babysit .
the cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with his name written over them .
well i have been there .
the final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law .
i even asked them why they brought electronic devices and all i got for an answer was a because .
finally the computers can teach hand-eye coordination .
as you can see i need my computer for many things .
many of the experiences were with people who spoke different languages or young children who i was able to connect with through laughter .
computers have a positive effect on people because you can learn about places you want to visit this <date> .
we turned to see she had managed to let her shoe fall of into a blackberry bush .
can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime .
when i was in what i believe to be the sixth grade i went to <organization> .
without all the useful information i found on the computer .
she was <caps> neat and clean that she got promoted .
he wanted that job more than a kid wanted ice cream .
just as my friend and i were in the car .
i had just arrived home from school and walked in the front door .
thats all that libraries like are people interested in reading their books .
it also is to show she is adapting to her new home .
so <caps> got out of the and walked about a <num> of a mile to the ticket booth .
so many uses for the computer .
do the same for us .
after they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play .
but as second road sign appeared he was relieved .
the author makes it so that you want to be <caps> and being able to smell the good food .
i believe that the book or magazine or <caps> should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it .
i had asked my mom and my dad if i could get it .
defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports .
the simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books .
a specific situation happened when i was about nine years old .
there is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there .
all in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific books
on our way home we danced around in the backseat and sang to all of the songs that we knew .
computer says computers are information in a compact <caps> out of <caps> people use the computer learn about far away places .
by growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need .
it curved right and the glove cracked .
another reason why computers is a positive affect to our country is because it can <caps> us communicate with our friends and family .
going over all those hills can really tire someone out .
the biggest obstacle was nature itself .
everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions .
i was suddenly jerked from my imagination when a small pixie looking girl took a seat beside me .
should be taken off the shelf because .
there was a long line to <caps> the tickets .
for example i read a very famous book called the <caps> of <person> by <person> .
not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments .
i was working on one thing and she was working on another .
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced were comprehended to late .
an their admiration for their strength and perseverance .
the communists censored everything inside the <caps> <caps> .
this shows that if family or friends needed help they were there for them .
there was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
i shared it with my mom who laughed very hard .
if people want to view those kind of things that other people find offensive they should buy them on their own time .
one obstacle was they had to make sure that the dirigibles could dock safely .
one way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books .
if you play games on the computer you can get a better hand-eye coordination .
those four hours could be spent with their families .
that is what can happen when buying something off of the <caps> .
so in the other words the computer is useful for students .
this is the mood the author creates in this memoir .
she knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home .
one of the greatest obstacle was because of safety .
all of the flowers reminded her home country .
this place <month> have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down .
i set my backpack down so that i could look for my daily planner .
an do our laundry like it was nothing .
but <caps> of this will happen if you stay on your computer <num> .
but if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem .
i thing that the <caps> should have all type of books in there because thats what a <caps> is for .
which means they would have to waste even more money .
he would listen and care as if it was his problem also .
and bubbles loves cheeses and cuddling with his duck buddies and with me in the calm <date> grass .
the wind at times could be too powerful .
thats what makes everyone special .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way .
just try to understand what there trying to say to you .
i really hope you will consider writing this article .
also your bills will get higher .
at <organization> they help with homework and projects .
so honestly it cant be that bad .
so all of the <num> kids start fighting .
laughter is a important part of life .
they also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face its needs .
i have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids .
he was pretty nice and very goofy .
that book would be taken away from all schools in the <location> brings us to this problem .
this is a story of a time i was of a time i was patient .
another problem was nature .
that indicates a new beginning or starting over .
this shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking .
that being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework .
so i immediately felt like i could be my self around my new friend and not worry about what he would think .
this quote only lists a few of his problems .
high school and i was feeling pretty confident .
it took four days to get down there .
as a kid we look up to our parents .
age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material .
if a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned .
computers keep people from exercising so their affect on people is negative .
as for me i am fine .
we walked and talked and he took pictures of everything .
i believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are offensive .
lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge .
during the <date> my family and i went to <location> for a couple weeks .
were happy together <person> told me <caps> we lay on his bed .
in the end of the story winter hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement .
it was the first day of sophomore year .
the builders made over sixty thousand dollars of modifications to the building structure in order to construct the mast .
if you have a computer at home you can build up your computer skills for school .
<organization> opened the <caps> and <caps> dad was not in there .
my teachers told me that we would get a letter in the mail telling us how much scholarship money i got .
we should teach people about them .
it should not be a big deal on what there about .
i pinned him in about <num> seconds .
in rough <caps> ahead the features of the setting and the cyclists surroundings greatly influence him .
after being patient it really pays off .
if they are found offensive to the public .
thats when we all started laughing .
i think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy .
it brings us closer .
the author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test .
computers can be used to interact with another .
he could do it again .
i needed a first period class and the only thing open was intro to manufacturing .
if you want to be on the computer instead of going outside thats your choice .
books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written .
the memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories .
i feel that trees have feelings like us but cant talk with out a mouth .
the <caps> to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station .
the plans were difficult the blimps and <caps> could crash and the mast height was too high .
the setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up .
that affects a lot of people <date> because there are a lot of people working on their computer for there jobs and they have to use the computer .
hearing <person> laugh again made me feel better about things because i knew that she had figured out it was not her fault for her <caps> leaving .
the thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful .
if you have a computer you will have video games .
because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life .
i once was in a library and read a magazine talking bad about teenage drivers .
i learned a lesson from <time> of to always scope out the area first before you go through it .
exercise is important <caps> people let that bobby .
computers can help everyone connect with anyone <caps> you can see computers have so many positive effects on people .
we go back whenever we know we can afford dessert and want to have a nice long laugh .
this time i knew it was a real love kiss .
papa <person> had asked if we were okay .
these are the items that teach us new things everyday .
<caps> was her second time going snowboarding and i have been snowboarding for about three years now .
when we got to <location> we hurry to the island school to see my sister .
the architects and engineers of the empire state building consulted with the experts .
over the next few months i waited patiently .
recently on the news i saw a segment of how at <organization> they are using robots to make surgery more efficient .
every girl for themselves .
happiness was showed in many different ways .
and when spring arrives and its still standing she can go take the test .
you bear of people using computers to do work all of the time .
this line describes the mood as extremely loving and touching because he is showing how much love he dedicates to his parents for the life he lived .
i have lots of stories of when i have maid people laugh .
i just think the memoir sets a happy mood .
in both of those classes we sit next to each other though .
also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging .
there were many obstacles that the architects never realized while building the docking station for the dirigibles .
<person> was ready to go home but <person> was determined to propose to her so he begged her to walk on the beach and watch the sun set .
i did not know <caps> was wrong with her and her sudden attitude changes until we got to the little playground my grandma has in the backyard .
a day went by and still nothing .
parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games .
how its filled with love and culture .
the features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change .
this would cause the dirigible to swing around the mast .
dear local newspaper- i understand that computers are becoming more of a must have in peoples everyday life .
this site was trebling .
to my belief a relationship formed on laughter is the strongest one of all .
computers are the devils tools .
but i feel that we can find a balance between the two views .
it was of me <caps> <person> .
some offensive things are part of <caps> and shows how things progressed from back then to now .
we were the kind of friends who could take one look at each other and start laughing thinking about a past memory we had .
this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
some books in libraries offended some people .
the story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him .
sixty-three percent <organization> the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most <organization> the time .
just because some people do not that material does not mean everyone wont like it .
also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for <num> to <num> year olds and on up .
so thats the time i was patient with my little brothers and sisters .
i personally think that reading is better <date> sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing <caps> .
this could help make work for school or jobs less stressful .
he could really call it home .
there is no way to express my gratitude shows that hes just so thankful there is not way to even express it .
the setting affects the biker in many ways .
that was the game cube .
we got our ticket and a map then we decided what ride we wanted to go on .
the computer in my thought helps you learn about new technology stuff such as new games to help you learn or new websites .
know matter what you are always be patient .
when they came up with one the company was mad that they mad a better one .
well if not then when you are not busy you should try it .
you can go on a website that has videos and short clips about what has been going on and learn about current events .
finally the biker faced his las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water .
another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story .
this is a story about what patience means to me .
then i had to just walk around doing nothing .
this is how i was patient .
everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books .
the purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff .
i felt depressed for the longest time .
she makes lots of random sounds .
if they do not like the book or movie then suggest to other peoples family not to read it or have them read it and see their reaction
you could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to .
we ended up staying there for a week or so in this little trailer that we took with us .
the architects overlooked the fact that most foreign ones were made of hydrogen not helium .
movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes .
this made me very unhealthy i gained nine pounds in one week .
<caps> mom and brother were out late .
my first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it can be educational .
my mom is very very busy .
here another reason why from the story .
dear newspaper <caps> <caps> my name is <person> and i am a student that attends <organization> .
i started laughing because i thought it was funny that my mom actually wrote me a note and stuck it in my back pack .
this creates a loving and family mood .
we went to the <organization> for children .
now lets talk about something .
these are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful .
she said and that was the <date> thing she said to me until we reached our destination .
the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a existing law .
laughter in someones life is very important for many different reasons .
another obstacle the builders of the empire state building faced was that dirigibles were highly flammable because they were filled with hydrogen .
the song <organization> by the <caps> <caps> was playing in the back ground .
all of us have our own opinion about what is offensive and what is not offensive .
and had the flavor of battery acid .
some people do not agree that computers are good .
i am able to understand how thirsty he is .
i complained again .
later on they realized dirigibles could not moor a the empire state building .
it makes them happy .
so i was patient playing in my room with all my toys .
most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out .
this once again made me feel sad and depressed .
in this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving .
then probably on his merry way to his destination .
computers help out with finding out what the weather is and everything you need to no .
with this desired title came many underlying obstacles like frame and support .
<caps> appreciates that his parents immigrated to the united states so <caps> can have a better life .
people will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer .
people view offensive writing and actions differently from one another .
i got to the cafeteria before many of the other students were in line .
she will take the test again .
i do not really understand that .
my <caps> <caps> came to the door first to greet us .
you can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live .
my voice was kinda shaky and i thought i was about to have a heart attack from nervousness and from surprise at <caps> <caps> said .
we followed <caps> sister to the ride .
that was a time i was very patient
let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil .
even adults listen to this stuff and watch all of this stuff .
the parade continued we started to become even more tired and hot from the sun .
they sacrificed their laboratory and chemical engineering jobs to work their way up from the very bottom in <location> to give their children more opportunity .
this all happened because he listened to the old guys .
<caps> i realized that laughter plays a big role in every ones life .
he said it was hot and that he was lost .
there should not and the key reason as to why is because it is history .
if a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed .
when you use a computer to communicate you are also saving money .
it also benefits society because in a couple years everything will be computers .
i was dying to go on it .
another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water .
we got there in in time to see the guys come out of the locker room .
he always has been the one who can always turn my frown upside down .
the last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships cant fly too low over urban areas .
music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves .
one of my examples of why i disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone .
i cant imagine completing any assignment without computer on my .
another obstacle that the architects faced was safety .
i paused for a long time .
<percent> of people should just get of the computer all the time and just chill with your family and friends .
laughter is what has kept me close to all of my peers throughout my life .
now when <caps> tries out .
we as <caps> <caps> take it very offensive when they are called someone in our own race a <caps> .
my kept saying <caps> you will be able to go out .
like he said in the memoir i will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home .
that way you could finish your story in time .
trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time .
<person> was her name and she drove a bright orange <organization> .
there are also things parents can do to ensure that the books their children are reading are appropriate and not offensive .
this makes the author need more water than he normally would .
when a book is published then it is sent to a library that way you can choose to read if you would like .
i would go on the computer and get all the information i need .
he says family had nothing to do with being a blood relative .
censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own .
the cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved .
i always give it my all when i feel like that .
laughter is needed in life to make it more livable .
after the first couple minutes of class i had found that the rumors were true .
there are three reasons why they should have censorship .
she refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is .
they were full <caps> and she wanted to bake something traditional for them .
teenagers are teenagers they must have technology .
so i did not get that book i just put it back and was mad at the people that treated my culture wrong .
i do it why cant you .
far from the reach where kids and children are able to access .
this can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers .
when allowing dirigibles to dock of the empire state building they were faced with many obstacles .
but laughing and smiling actually make everything hurt worse instead of making it better .
these are the three reasons why i think the effects of the computer are bad .
computers have varies websites such as <caps> and <caps> which can distract people from studying or even doing their homework .
every year more people become impatient .
in all relationships laughter is a big thing because it can always come in handle .
the author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there .
this would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the empire state building .
you have all these things you condo .
i was one of the last people off our bus which means i was one of the last to order .
it all depends on the situation where this material is distributed in .
<caps> you for letting me know that .
the variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular .
also in there houses they have music going on all the time .
i had never talked to this boy but there was something very intriguing about him .
i could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here .
because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water .
well thats what i got for using the <caps> for knowledge .
this shows the authors love for culinary skills .
since your eyes are already bad you might think well they cant get any worse .
you <month> be thinking that we just do it for fun and that its enjoyable and nothing wrong with it .
computers are a good thing because you could email your family or friends any time you want too .
thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her .
mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words .
that was a time where i had to be very patient .
i am most patient during tests .
going out do instead of sitting a computer is a sure way to healthy .
thats why people should use the computers .
i had missed about an inning of the game already .
it also allowed to see how full and good his was to .
there was a surprise birthday party for me with presents and friends and everything .
you can make a difference in the way people feel about computers .
i was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was .
my third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer .
the variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation .
that was the only time i was patient of learning .
the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways .
<caps> he always say hello to everyone in company with his big laugh .
the law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area .
so when i see him running all over the place it makes me laugh .
there are <num> big reasons .
i was finally their i ordered my burger when i was done it was worth the wait .
i believe that computers have a baseline effect on people .
i had a very peculiar flavor with berries in it .
one obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars to the worth of modifications for the buildings framework .
thats almost everyone .
people were waiting for their flight to <location> .
later that day my <caps> and i were at school reading our books she came up to me in the hallway .
when the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain .
a time i was patient at <organization> .
nothing is causing obesity in <location> them computer .
my younger sister warmed up to him first .
<caps> i thought her cloth need changing .
i also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about .
we kept telling ourselves that we would rebuild it but we never got to it .
those book <month> also have bad language in them to .
in the story <person> always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile .
one reason why computers help us is by teaching hand-eye coordination .
one example was in paragraph <num> .
most people would be offended and complain .
<caps> took a little while but <caps> was my turn next .
this is a very opinionated topic .
each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive .
the bus drivers hurried their way to the <caps> <caps> .
it was dead silent .
everything that was on <caps> was not as bad in my opinion .
its just easier to live with it .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong .
i think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created .
i would let them know how i felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner .
computers give kids so much knowledge about things they would not be able to do or go in real life .
i said before laughing again .
all the facts of life and the world are put into it .
most dirigibles <caps> using highly flammable gases such as hydrogen .
it used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women .
a family that i have been close to my whole life had moved to <location> due to jobs .
during this decade many sports games have come out for the computer .
playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer .
the right they are messing with to me is the right of freedom .
in conclusion i informed you on why i dislike computers .
the flower makes her happy and reminds her of home .
in the end we just agreed that we had to be ourselves around each other .
i just have less time to hangout with friends or simply rest .
foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with .
she snatched her keys and we hurried into the car .
not all laughter is not funny .
i asked my dad <caps> i could use the computer .
then also the thing i can never be patient for is waiting for a friend to call because i always want to do something every second .
i got news for you .
they thought that she should not listen to <caps> because the lyrics in the songs were too sad for her to hear .
the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
with computer you can look up available homes and apartments .
for example if i wanted to i could talk to someone and the <caps> and clean my room .
you should be with your family and and friends .
television is basically the same for movies .
laughter brought me to a good place in life .
just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life .
thats how i feel about censorship in a library .
it was around lunch time and i was watching out the window while eating cold pizza .
then as i walked onto the field they all grew a smile .
<caps> i know i said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this .
patient so he walked in and took a number and got his paper from the woman .
the authors mood that he wanted you to feel was that your family and house was loving .
books can be helpful defending on when it was made .
you have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library .
no matter how you try to keep your kids away from finding or seeing offensive stuff there is always a way for them to see it .
hes excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path .
the mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood .
a majority of peoples time is spent on the computer .
i remove the previously stated graphic romance novels .
i remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books .
this was going to be a long car ride .
it keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn .
they are both rated differently on levels of age .
looking back at it always makes me laugh and realize that my errors could have been much worse but as it turned out they were just minor set backs .
then <person> though to herself i got to be patient .
you can find this all out on the computer .
when he see the first comp he is overwhelmed with relief and the terrain flattens out again .
but all she noticed was my hysterical laughing .
her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her drivers test again in the spring .
a third obstacle they were facing was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents .
libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you .
censorship causes people to become uneducated which on the other hand makes it illegal for a person to speak out against something even if it <caps> wrong .
we were setting up party stuff and cleaning the house and the apartment because thats were the boys will be hanging out and sleeping .
and how important he learned that family and friends are .
this features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind .
the funny thing is the pictures were not that good and that just shows how bad of a spy we actually were .
books and magazines are two fun things people love to read .
while using a computer you can <caps> many things .
i jumped out of bed without a word and began walking to the kitchen .
the author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time .
this factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state .
she buried her face in her pillow trying to block the images .
<caps> this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area .
i turned even to see the stud coming down .
the mood of this memoir is that <person> is happy being with his family because he believes you should always love your family .
my grandmother shared a memory about when i was <location> learning to read .
now the lunch line .
being patient is a very hand thing for me but one day i learned my lesson .
one problem was actually docking the zeppelins or dirigibles .
the main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer .
that made us realize that we were a lot alike .
this quote shows how the girl was getting use to the united states .
filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the building .
winds at the top of the building were also dangerous .
in conclusion compare use be encouraged .
some one might say people are spending too much time on their computer .
those are some of the obstacle the builder faced .
also the dirigible are highly flammable because the used hydrogen rather than helium .
in reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast .
with a computer everyone can learn about people all over .
going to the library is always a struggle when someone is faced with so many different genres of books .
the geese come back .
i looked at him puzzled because it was not the reply i expected .
i would lie awake at night sometimes and wish that maybe someday someone out there would listen and care and understand .
this is what my life felt like when the world turned around and i found out my best friend just flipped her car .
one accident and tons of lives would be at stake .
along with the students in the room .
in the story he says the bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water .
i had watched girls stuff shells into there bathing suits before .
we could always rely on <caps> for an unrelated metaphor .
we would sit there and watch the whole playground during recess while reflecting on our stressful lives .
then in <location> next class she could feel everyones eyes on her but she knew it was for a good reason .
i firmly believe that the effects of computers are overwhelming positive .
sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them .
in this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland .
also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on .
laughter is much more than an emotion .
the heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride .
instead of going to the library and hoping that theres a book on him .
the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too .
each parent has different values and standards for their child .
everyday we have choices .
laughter is what id like to call a <caps> <caps> of <caps> .
first off <caps> is a major concern many blimps were filled with hydrogen which is extremely explosive .
many jobs need you to be able to work well with your hands .
because we are all the same .
then i saw that <caps> from three of my classes .
patience is also about waiting .
he arrived at the first town which was a ghost town .
the fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone .
the builders of the building did not realize the severity of the obstacles preventing them from safely accomplishing this feat .
everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive .
i was starting quarterback and i scored <num> touchdowns and i passing touchdown just in the first half .
it was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame .
i yelled for my big brother who was playing his game .
they could what there for three hours and not be herd .
getting frustrated would have made my time harder and not as enjoyable .
taking media off the shelves is not needed .
second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature .
computers can the history of place not us .
but most of the time i sleep .
the author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change .
i will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice .
in the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it .
one of the girls tripped as we were walking out the door and it took all we had to not burst out in laughter .
taking away computers would drastically impact every day life .
you also read about new subjects and learn new things on computers possibly helping you in your classes or .
we were being very patient .
we all looked at each other and started trying to find away back with making the least mess .
language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate .
the mooring mast on the empire state building was intentionally built for dirigible docking .
computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family .
later that night she got fifth row seats close enough to see the sweat on <person> face that shows how being patient can end up in a good result .
he believed himself that he can be alive .
me and him meet only once a year .
i went and got them water .
<person> sat for two hours .
so the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite .
there are many different ways on how the mood was created by the author in the memoir .
even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial .
laying there anxiously someone whispers here it comes .
were starting to bleed .
this would make the docking station unsafe if the dirigible ever caught on fire .
the next lunch i went with her feeling sweaty-hand nervous the entire time .
thats the order they go in from size and how hard it is to <person> them .
they put <money> of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building .
he said that he would never forget his parent that turned this simple house into a home .
the setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist .
the third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible .
yes you can learn thinks by the computer but you can also learn by doing it yourself .
this session also we would be writing a paper about how the fight had changed us .
you see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them .
the dirigible could <caps> over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all .
although technology is progressing computers are only the basics .
he was given back roads that are abandoned now .
laughter is a huge part of anyones life .
thats why they should not watch it .
i looked at the contact .
i said that i did not know how much it is .
the computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed .
magazines in my opinion should be censored .
like for example rap music .
thats <caps> different place .
i also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from .
my boyfriend and i met about three years ago .
i sat there with tears in my eyes .
computers are a waste of money .
friends and family are extremely important in peoples lives .
if a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so .
restrictions on renting that material could be set .
the steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened this would be over sixty thousand dollars .
everyone needs to hear it because <caps> true .
nothing should be blocked from the public .
knowledge of suicide is also something i think should be available .
this memoir is all about heritage and the home .
i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult shows .
they went around the suburban at least five times before he caught up to her .
memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test .
and very generous because her parents moved for her education .
the fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the empire state building was not approved by nature .
students in classes write reports for projects or even for class work .
my mother did it big for my birthday party .
however thats what his parents did .
the terrain during the cyclists journey greatly affects him .
he had people at his house for dinners .
the mood created by the author is touching .
magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world .
i was in class waiting i new that it would come soon .
these were a few of many obstacles the workers faced
another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future .
such as <organization> word .
<caps> mood that the memoir sets is the mood of family and friends .
<caps> book can be given a nasty comment but then again <caps> book can also be given the best comments .
also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it <month> offend them .
it is everyones own choice to read a book or listen to a <location> .
we both have changed a lot and we both knew we would be very good friends .
the fog made it hard to see who u were hitting and who was throwing it at you .
<caps> it got started .
i cant even count the number of times i have been in a complete laughing fit because of <caps> friend <location> .
the apartment was the jail .
after walking around a while this girl talked to me .
another thing is those game websites .
she still has hope of passing the drivers test .
this <caps> not a good way to spend time .
many off the books todays youth read are offensive to older generations .
sometimes people will do anything to get help or go anywhere to find it .
then they took me to the room my mom was in and we waited for <num> min .
she said i cant have one till <num> grade unless i get a <caps> phone write now and cant till ninth grade to get a real phone .
so later that nigh we went home really hungry .
the books reflected upon good vs .
should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive .
you can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead .
he was the uphill on a rocky roll-a-coaster .
it gives a whole new look on things .
my dad and i went out to teach me how to drive after recently getting my permit .
it could also crash into other buildings .
he would have us going around in circles at about <num> mph .
our flight left at <time> am so we were there at <num> .
its a honest way of making money .
i believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what .
its important to avoid stereotypes because those can be hurtful .
i never even saw them before .
the many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful .
it is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way .
there is no one person who can say whether or not a book is offensive .
the door slammed on my dads truck .
this sentence shows me that <person> is slowly getting used to the new place .
the opinion of one person should not effect materials being able to be on a shelf or not .
i know that you can break free from it because i once experienced the same thing .
one major problem with the idea that the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame .
while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building the workers faced many obstacles .
sense that day <person> and i have been glued to each others sides as best <caps> .
it tells you new things that are in your town or what their going to make or it tells you what it is getting rid of .
their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship .
i was getting ready to wrestle and i seen <caps> warming up across the gym from <caps> .
she was gorgeous so i was attracted <caps> her immediately .
and he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out .
although it would have opened new doors for means of travel there were too many safety violation for it to be worth while .
the mood created by the author in the memoir is how he was living with his family in the house .
those are three of the most important reasons why i think computers benefit society .
so computers do have a positive effect on people .
like i said before we all have our own opinions .
she took one of the salt shakers and started pounding it on the table .
then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found .
and that was a very patient day .
even better to a family member .
he worked hard to support me and my brother .
i do not think that there should be censorship in libraries
not to be mean or anything .
not to mention the computer did quicker and more efficient than a regular human .
i know that laughter made my relationship so much better .
you cant really take anything out of a library because either way their would be a lot of upset people .
the builders of the empire state building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there .
they knew how dangerous it was .
a mature person will not want to read elementary books their entire life .
there can be different censorship on individual people too .
the effects on the computer puts on us can vary .
all my relatives on my dads side were there .
i am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good .
what the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work .
the next morning <caps> up and go outside to try and train dog .
i find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair .
it is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world .
it <month> be offensive to some people but there will be some other people in the world that likes that same book .
he drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated .
these books are known as <caps> books .
he will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life .
many places show and sell offensive material .
all of these obstacles tying into another .
i think the world would be a happier place if everyone could laugh .
i was going to sit here for a few hours so so <num> <caps> ill read something .
the invention of the mass on top of the empire state building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws .
books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out .
a time i was patient was when i was at a dentist office i had to get six teeth pulled .
it was fun for a while but i wanted to actually meet the guy .
you just sit there staring at a screen .
two years have passed since <person> mom had left .
these things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use .
<caps> only i waited .
it took her awhile to take them though because she is not that good or fast at taking pictures .
so if you need to find a job then you can go on the computer and find a job that is right for you .
laughter is the most important part when you meet other people .
after the <caps> cousins wedding <caps> dad said <caps> go fishing .
my cousins each go on the computer <num> hours a day .
the slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship .
in every library you wont see that all the books are perfectly good .
people of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it .
my other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended .
a landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future .
another obstacle the builders faced was the law .
everybody has a different taste in media .
i had changed as person when life when life burned me one to many times .
most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities .
i looked at the picture laughed and smiled i liked it .
turns out thats not allowed in <organization> either .
you can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book .
if we do stop this way of life then things could get better and then our planet <caps> will stay around longer and we could make the a better place .
they get all couped up inside for the whole day .
these are the reasons why dirigibles never moored on the empire state building due to the many obstacles .
its a tough world out there for these kids and they should be taught the best way that they can
based on the memoir the mood created by the author in the memoir was filled with lots of love and satisfaction .
<caps> had to make sure uncle <person> was ready to leave .
before we got on we had to pay a <money> each .
<caps> one is based in <location> with <caps> training to be a hero .
and he looks at them .
the first <caps> the <caps> encountered was the wind .
what <date> be offensive to one parent <date> not be to another .
the heat made his dehydration situation much worse .
not only that but you can also meet new friends on the computer by talking about games or popular <caps> .
he then asked me how did that happen .
and you are understanding and tolerant .
that would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands .
websites such as <caps> and <caps> are also causes of this .
family had nothing to do with being blood relative .
it was a great <organization> to be outside doing something unique to enjoy the nice weather .
<organization> said yeah sure .
this relates to the quote because it states they struggled .
some teens would be horrified of looking through these books and others would be fascinated by it .
of course <person> said <caps> .
hope was <caps> because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family .
it was in the middle of <date> and we were sitting outside on top of the wooden table in our mothers backyard .
i was also in the sixth grade .
laughter is one of the most important elements in ones life .
the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation .
he was so proud to have parents who cared so much and had such selflessness .
i knew he would get it soon .
libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone .
i believe in each and everyone of our lives we all have a special moment we desire to worship forever .
virtual people are not your real friends and family .
there were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist .
on a computer you can find great things about a place and people .
i think that things that are bad should be removed from the selves and placed some where else .
this style of communication has ever a new type of bullying .
we had to wait for what seemed like forever .
students use the <caps> for many reasons .
be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation .
the other largest obstacle was safety .
that is what i think the mood created by the author was .
hope you get something out of what i wrote .
i herd that criss rock almost died .
there are many other uses is you just cant find your family is counting on you .
i mostly wanted it because <organization> is the company that makes it and this is the last game <organization> was making because some other company bought the <caps> series from <organization> .
i met my best friend <person> when we were in kindergarten .
this was an occasion <caps> i need someone else there to help <caps> .
if that was my stuff that had got took off the shelves i would be shocked and upset .
but before we go he said can you cut the grass for me .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there .
so please help yourselves and the earth stop talking on the computers and get out and do something productive .
i mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing .
laughter is also an extremely helpful tool .
but i was still nervous .
i have and i have to say it was rewarding .
the only thing good about the movie is <caps> was a few dramatic and thats it .
he overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views .
this quote makes me feel so happy that i have a family that supports me and is always there for me .
if you want to know more about different cultures such as <caps> <caps> .
in <person> the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion .
the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation .
libraries have the absolute best resources a place could have or ever wanted .
can we watch <organization> .
this left the designers to deal with the problem of a dirigible swinging around the mooring mast .
this essay <month> make no difference but it has said what needed to be said and thus served its purpose .
my brother was the first to jump .
this is a question that all of us have thought about at one point or another .
there was an indent of where the bottle hit the door .
so that i can help the team .
the desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function .
in two days of fun it is already our last day at <caps> .
he needed to be happy .
personally i think computers have a good influence on people .
that is important because nobody wants to live a short miserable life .
mooring a dirigible to the top of it .
these all made it much harder to put a mast on the empire state building .
the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in the idea of docking a dirigible to a building of such height .
when we got back my parents were another back .
the author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents .
this quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building .
i went home and fell asleep then my mom woke <caps> up and said use had to go pick that up .
people that think those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people .
thank you very much .
since then <caps> my friend does is go on the computer .
i looked at the clock and it said six thirty a .
they also appeal to a lot of people across the world .
my poor little brother .
many other people believe that laughter is a very important part of relationships that they are having .
for those parents or people who disagree with what is shown on the shelf .
he knows me better than anybody else .
i <caps> well ill teach you .
all <caps> you will have to type one time or another .
i was really really mad .
its not like they are watching anything bad .
the worst time to be patient is the night before you can open your presents .
i had no idea on how to shift and when to exactly .
if he did not say any impatient comments i would owe her two dollars .
<caps> something that <caps> commonly said .
after a few minutes of talking she sent us off to <caps> our first scene .
my family was so thoroughly entertained <caps> my laughter that they could not keep their smiles <caps> laughter tucked away without bursting into giggles as bad as mine .
so these are just some of the reasons i think computers could be bad .
its one that you expect to feel when you are happy or humorous .
there is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all .
censorship should not even exist
many of the reasons had to do with safety .
authors have just the same right as we do .
i know patients is the key to deer hunting so i will just have to wait .
we decided to meet at my grandmas house .
after three day i missed my school bus .
builders would have to learn new technologies for operating the system at the u .
the final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas .
another reason why laughter is so important in a relationship would be the sound of your laugh .
some very adults have and various other things that i cannot the life of me think of <caps> thing computer get them together and they are happy .
are great for kids in libraries .
the modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses .
the greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety .
his team <caps> the game .
in conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal .
so of course i was upset .
we will never have the social our parents i feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them .
most of my friends do it with me .
censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools .
my sister has a computer in her bedroom and i barely see her at all .
i looked at the teacher and she started busting out laughing .
especially the moments with the ones that <caps> love .
get away from the computer and bond .
then when we got there we set up our tent and then went fishing .
